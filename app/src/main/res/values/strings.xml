    <string name="top10"> 10. Bondi Beach, Sydney

Location Bondi, Sydney NSW

We can see you rolling your eyes through the screen right now - however, bear with us. Bondi makes the list simply because no Aussie beach countdown is complete without having it on board. Less about the actual quality of the beach itself and more about the surroundings, atmosphere, history and people watching, like it or not, Sydney‘s famous stretch of sand at Bondi is a long-time fixture and also something of an icon in Aussie beach culture.
 9. Lizard Island, QLD

Location Near Cairns, Far North Queensland

The entire Great Barrier Reef in general offers a cavalcade of amazing spectacles, not the least of which are beaches. However, two destinations, in particular, stand out among the many choices as far as we are concerned (another of which you’ll come across later on this list). In terms of islands, you’d be hard pressed to find a higher concentration of great beaches-per-square-metre than on the stunning Lizard Island, which boasts 23 separate stunning white beaches over the relatively small area of just over 1000 hectares.

Lizard island sits on the eastern side of the Great Barrier Reef and is a picture-perfect example of an amazing island getaway. There’s only one thing standing in the way, however, as one of the most exclusive beach destinations in the country, you’ll have to have deep wallets if you want to spend time here.
